# 🧠 **1. Handling AJAX-based Applications**

AJAX allows parts of a web page to update without refreshing the entire page. This introduces synchronization issues in automation, so we need **explicit waits** to ensure Selenium waits for content to load or elements to become visible/invisible.

### ✅ **1.1 Automating AJAX Requests**

#### 📝 Explanation:
AJAX elements are loaded **asynchronously**. You can't interact with them immediately. Use `WebDriverWait` and `ExpectedConditions` to wait until they’re available.

#### 💻 Code:
```java
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://example.com/ajax-page");

// Wait for the AJAX-loaded content to appear
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
WebElement ajaxElement = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("ajaxContent")));

System.out.println("Loaded content: " + ajaxElement.getText());
```

#### 🖨️ Output (Example):
```
Loaded content: AJAX Content Loaded Successfully
```

### ⏳ **1.2 Handling Loading Spinners & Progress Bars**

#### 📝 Explanation:
Spinners or loaders are common during AJAX calls. You should wait for them to **disappear** before continuing further interactions.

#### 💻 Code:
```java
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://example.com/ajax-page");

// Wait for the loading spinner to disappear
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("loadingSpinner")));

System.out.println("Spinner is gone, continue actions.");
```

#### 🖨️ Output:
```
Spinner is gone, continue actions.
```
